11.1. Listing running processes:

Containers, due to their isolated nature, will often have very little processes running in comparison to something such as a virtual machine. We can simply use `ps aux` to print the running processes. Note in the screenshot below that there are very few processes running?

A virtual machine has a tonne more processes running in comparison. In the case of my virtual machine, there were 312 at the time of listing.

11.2. Looking for .dockerenv

Containers allow environment variables to be provided from the host operating system by the use of a ".dockerenv" file. This file is located in the "/" directory, and would exist on a container - even if no environment variables were provided: `cd / && ls -lah`

11.3. Those pesky cgroups

Note how we utilised "cgroups" in Task 10. Cgroups are used by containerisation software such as LXC or Docker. Let's look for them with by navigating to "/proc/1" and then _catting_ the "cgroups" file...It is worth mentioning that the "cgroups" file contains paths including the word "docker":
