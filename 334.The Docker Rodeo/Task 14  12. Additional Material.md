**12.1.** Conclusion

There are a few other exploits that I was not able to cover such as the dirtyc0w kernel exploitation. I implore you to get familiar with Docker, create your own instances and play around!

You may also find variants of the capabilities exploit such as "runC" interesting.

Anyways, I hope you enjoyed it! Don't be afraid to stick around in this room and experiment. [~CMNatic](https://tryhackme.com/p/CMNatic)
