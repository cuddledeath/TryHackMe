In late March 2022, two remote command execution vulnerabilities in the Java [Spring framework](https://spring.io/) were made public. The first of these vulnerabilities affects a component of the framework called "Spring Cloud Functions". The second, arguably more serious vulnerability, affects a component in  "Spring Core" —  the heart of the framework — thus significantly increasing the vulnerability's potential impact and earning it the name "Spring4Shell" (a play on [Log4Shell](https://tryhackme.com/room/solar), the name of a brutal vulnerability disclosed at the end of 2021).

For various reasons, there has been a lot of confusion surrounding these vulnerabilities in the wider infosec community. As such, this room may be updated as new information comes to light. On a similar note, the impact of Spring4Shell is currently unknown; only time will tell how wide-spread the vulnerability is in the wild.  

This room will provide an overview of the Spring4Shell RCE vulnerability in Spring Core, as well as give you an opportunity to exploit it for yourself in the vulnerable machine attached to this task. We will start by taking a look at the vulnerability at a high-level, before exploiting the target machine for ourselves.
