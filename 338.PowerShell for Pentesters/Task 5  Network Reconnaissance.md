The following command can be used to ping a given IP range. In this example, we will ping the IP addresses from 10.0.2.1 to 10.0.2.15

The first part of the command, delimited by the "|" character, sets the range for the last octet. The second part generates and prints the IP address to be used and pipes it to the command line. Finally, the last part greps lines that include the “TTL” string.

A similar command can be built using the existing socket and TCP client functions. In the example below, we scan the first 1024 TCP ports of the target. Note that the “`2>$null`” sends any error to null, providing us with a cleaner output.
