There are numerous ways to download files from a remote server using PowerShell. One of the quickest ways can be seen below. This will connect to the remote host (10.0.2.8 in this case) and download the`meterpreter-64.ps1`. The file is saved as “`meterpreter.ps1`”.

The screenshot below shows a sample lab setup used with Kali running a Python HTTP server on port 8888 (`python3 -m http.server 8888`).

Once the script has been downloaded, you may run into the first related to PowerShell: ExecutionPolicy. It is important to note that, as Microsoft clearly states in the related documentation, “`ExecutionPolicy`” is NOT a security feature. It merely functions as an added safety measure and can be bypassed by the user.

The current state of the ExecutionPolicy configuration can be seen using “`Get-ExecutionPolicy -list`”

Execution policies can have seven different values;

1.  AllSigned: Scripts can run but require all scripts to be signed by a trusted publisher.
2.  Bypass: All scripts can run, and no warnings or prompts will be displayed.
3.  Default: This refers to “restricted” for Windows clients and “RemoteSigned” for Windows servers.
4.  RemoteSigned: Scripts can run, and this does not require local scripts to be digitally signed.
5.  Restricted: The default configuration for Windows clients. Allows individual commands to run, does not allow scripts.
6.  Undefined: This shows that no specific execution policy was set. This means default execution policies will be enforced.
7.  Unrestricted: Most scripts will run.

As mentioned earlier, ExecutionPolicy is not a security feature and can be bypassed by users. The user has several alternatives to bypass the ExecutionPolicy; however, some methods may require the user to have administrator account privileges.

The most common way to bypass execution policy can be seen below:

Another option could be to use “`Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass`” with the scope set for the process. The “`-scope`” parameter will set the execution policy only for the current PowerShell session and will go back to the initial settings once the PowerShell session is closed.

Another easy way to download files from a remote server is to use the “`Invoke-WebRequest`” command.
