# **TryHackMe**

### This is my repository of notes and answers for various TryHackMe rooms. 

### They are not formatted very well as I just copy and paste the entire task description into a file. So the images may look very large.

### These are not to be considered write ups.

### Only utilize if you're truly desperate for an answer.
