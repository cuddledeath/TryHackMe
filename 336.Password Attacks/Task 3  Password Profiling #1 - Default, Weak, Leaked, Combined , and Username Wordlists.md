Having a good wordlist is critical to carrying out a successful password attack. It is important to know how you can generate username lists and password lists. In this section, we will discuss creating targeted username and password lists. We will also cover various topics, including default, weak, leaked passwords, and creating targeted wordlists.  

Default Passwords  

Before performing password attacks, it is worth trying a couple of default passwords against the targeted service. Manufacturers set default passwords with products and equipment such as switches, firewalls, routers. There are scenarios where customers don't change the default password, which makes the system vulnerable. Thus, it is a good practice to try out admin:admin, admin:123456, etc. If we know the target device, we can look up the default passwords and try them out. For example, suppose the target server is a Tomcat, a lightweight, open-source Java application server. In that case, there are a couple of possible default passwords we can try: admin:admin or tomcat:admin.

Here are some website lists that provide default passwords for various products.

Weak Passwords  
Professionals collect and generate weak password lists over time and often combine them into one large wordlist. Lists are generated based on their experience and what they see in pentesting engagements. These lists may also contain leaked passwords that have been published publically. Here are some of the common weak passwords lists :

-   [https://wiki.skullsecurity.org/index.php?title=Passwords](https://wiki.skullsecurity.org/index.php?title=Passwords)[](https://wiki.skullsecurity.org/index.php?title=Passwords) - This includes the most well-known collections of passwords.
-   [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Passwords) - A huge collection of all kinds of lists, not only for password cracking.

### Leaked Passwords

Sensitive data such as passwords or hashes may be publicly disclosed or sold as a result of a breach. These public or privately available leaks are often referred to as 'dumps'. Depending on the contents of the dump, an attacker may need to extract the passwords out of the data. In some cases, the dump may only contain hashes of the passwords and require cracking in order to gain the plain-text passwords. The following are some of the common password lists that have weak and leaked passwords, including webhost, elitehacker,hak5, Hotmail, PhpBB companies' leaks:

### Combined wordlists  

Let's say that we have more than one wordlist. Then, we can combine these wordlists into one large file. This can be done as follows using cat:

cewl

```shell-session
cat file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt > combined_list.txt
```

To clean up the generated combined list to remove duplicated words, we can use sort and uniq as follows:

cewl

```shell-session
sort combined_list.txt | uniq -u > cleaned_combined_list.txt
```

### Customized Wordlists  

Customizing password lists is one of the best ways to increase the chances of finding valid credentials. We can create custom password lists from the target website. Often, a company's website contains valuable information about the company and its employees, including emails and employee names. In addition, the website may contain keywords specific to what the company offers, including product and service names, which may be used in an employee's password!   

Tools such as Cewl can be used to effectively crawl a website and extract strings or keywords. Cewl is a powerful tool to generate a wordlist specific to a given company or target. Consider the following example below:

cewl

```shell-session
user@thm$ cewl -w list.txt -d 5 -m 5 http://thm.labs
```

-w will write the contents to a file. In this case, list.txt.

-m 5 gathers strings (words) that are 5 characters or more

-d 5 is the depth level of web crawling/spidering (default 2)

http://thm.labs is the URL that will be used

As a result, we should now have a decently sized wordlist based on relevant words for the specific enterprise, like names, locations, and a lot of their business lingo. Similarly, the wordlist that was created could be used to fuzz for usernames. 

Apply what we discuss using cewl against https://clinic.thmredteam.com/ to parse all words and generate a wordlist with a minimum length of 8. Note that we will be using this wordlist later on with another task!

### Username Wordlists

Gathering employees' names in the enumeration stage is essential. We can generate username lists from the target's website. For the following example, we'll assume we have a {first name} {last name} (ex: John Smith) and a method of generating usernames.

-   **{first name}:** john
-   **{last name}:** smith
-   **{first name}{last name}:  johnsmith** 
-   **{last name}{first name}:  smithjohn** 
-   first letter of the **{first name}{last name}: jsmith** 
-   first letter of the **{last name}{first name}: sjohn** 
-   first letter of the **{first name}.{first name}: j.smith** 
-   first letter of the **{first name}-{first name}: j-smith** 
-   and so on

Thankfully, there is a tool username_generator that could help create a list with most of the possible combinations if we have a first name and last name.

Usernames

```shell-session
user@thm$ git clone https://github.com/therodri2/username_generator.git
Cloning into 'username_generator'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 9, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (9/9), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (7/7), done.
remote: Total 9 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Receiving objects: 100% (9/9), done.

user@thm$ cd username_generator
```

Using python3 username_generator.py -h shows the tool's help message and optional arguments.

Usernames

```shell-session
user@thm$ python3 username_generator.py -h
usage: username_generator.py [-h] -w wordlist [-u]

Python script to generate user lists for bruteforcing!

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -w wordlist, --wordlist wordlist
                        Specify path to the wordlist
  -u, --uppercase       Also produce uppercase permutations. Disabled by default
```

Now let's create a wordlist that contains the full name John Smith to a text file. Then, we'll run the tool to generate the possible combinations of the given full name.

Usernames

```shell-session
user@thm$ echo "John Smith" > users.lst
user@thm$ python3 username_generator.py -w users.lst
usage: username_generator.py [-h] -w wordlist [-u]
john
smith
j.smith
j-smith
j_smith
j+smith
jsmith
smithjohn
```

This is just one example of a custom username generator. Please feel free to explore more options or even create your own in the programming language of your choice!
