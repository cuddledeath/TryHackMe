### Keyspace Technique

Another way of preparing a wordlist is by using the key-space technique. In this technique, we specify a range of characters, numbers, and symbols in our wordlist. crunch is one of many powerful tools for creating an offline wordlist. With crunch, we can specify numerous options, including min, max, and options as follows:

crunch

```shell-session
user@thm$ crunch -h
crunch version 3.6

Crunch can create a wordlist based on the criteria you specify.  
The output from crunch can be sent to the screen, file, or to another program.

Usage: crunch   [options]
where min and max are numbers

Please refer to the man page for instructions and examples on how to use crunch.
```

  

The following example creates a wordlist containing all possible combinations of 2 characters, including 0-4 and a-d. We can use the -o argument and specify a file to save the output to. 

crunch

```shell-session
user@thm$ crunch 2 2 01234abcd -o crunch.txt
Crunch will now generate the following amount of data: 243 bytes
0 MB
0 GB
0 TB
0 PB
Crunch will now generate the following number of lines: xx
crunch: 100% completed generating output
```

Here is a snippet of the output:

crunch

```shell-session
user@thm$ cat crunch.txt
00
01
02
03
04
0a
0b
0c
0d
10
.
.
.
cb
cc
cd
d0
d1
d2
d3
d4
da
db
dc
dd
```

It's worth noting that crunch can generate a very large text file depending on the word length and combination options you specify. The following command creates a list with an 8 character minimum and maximum length containing numbers 0-9, a-f lowercase letters, and A-F uppercase letters:

crunch 8 8 0123456789abcdefABCDEF -o crunch.txt the file generated is 459 GB and contains 54875873536 words.

crunch also lets us specify a character set using the -t option to combine words of our choice. Here are some of the other options that could be used to help create different combinations of your choice:  

@ - lower case alpha characters

, - upper case alpha characters

% - numeric characters

^ - special characters including space

For example, if part of the password is known to us, and we know it starts with pass and follows two numbers, we can use the % symbol from above to match the numbers. Here we generate a wordlist that contains pass followed by 2 numbers:

crunch

```shell-session
user@thm$  crunch 6 6 -t pass%%
Crunch will now generate the following amount of data: 700 bytes
0 MB
0 GB
0 TB
0 PB
Crunch will now generate the following number of lines: 100
pass00
pass01
pass02
pass03
```

### CUPP - Common User Passwords Profiler

CUPP is an automatic and interactive tool written in Python for creating custom wordlists. For instance, if you know some details about a specific target, such as their birthdate, pet name, company name, etc., this could be a helpful tool to generate passwords based on this known information. CUPP will take the information supplied and generate a custom wordlist based on what's provided. There's also support for a 1337/leet mode, which substitutes the letters a, i,e, t, o, s, g, z  with numbers. For example, replace a  with 4  or i with 1. For more information about the tool, please visit the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/Mebus/cupp).

To run CUPP, we need python 3 installed. Then clone the GitHub repo to your local machine using git as follows:

CUPP

```shell-session
user@thm$  git clone https://github.com/Mebus/cupp.git
Cloning into 'cupp'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 237, done.
remote: Total 237 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 237
Receiving objects: 100% (237/237), 2.14 MiB | 1.32 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (125/125), done.
```

Now change the current directory to CUPP and run python3 cupp.py or with -h to see the available options.

CUPP

```shell-session
user@thm$  python3 cupp.py
 ___________
   cupp.py!                 # Common

usage: cupp.py [-h] [-i | -w FILENAME | -l | -a | -v] [-q]

Common User Passwords Profiler

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  -i, --interactive  Interactive questions for user password profiling
  -w FILENAME        Use this option to improve existing dictionary, or WyD.pl output to make some pwnsauce
  -l                 Download huge wordlists from repository
  -a                 Parse default usernames and passwords directly from Alecto DB. Project Alecto uses purified
                     databases of Phenoelit and CIRT which were merged and enhanced
  -v, --version      Show the version of this program.
  -q, --quiet        Quiet mode (don't print banner)
```

CUPP supports an interactive mode where it asks questions about the target and based on the provided answers, it creates a custom wordlist. If you don't have an answer for the given field, then skip it by pressing the Enter key.

CUPP

```shell-session
user@thm$  python3 cupp.py -i

      \                     # User

ِAs a result, a custom wordlist that contains various numbers of words based on your entries is generated. Pre-created wordlists can be downloaded to your machine as follows:

Based on your interest, you can choose the wordlist from the list above to aid in generating wordlists for brute-forcing!

Finally, CUPP could also provide default usernames and passwords from the Alecto database by using the -l option.
